# Handmade Hero & Handmade Penguin

I'm a follower of [Handmade Hero](http://handmadehero.org/) which is
been written and explained by [Casey Muratori](http://mollyrocket.com/casey/about.html).

Although since currently (13th of December 2014) all the explanation has been around Windows OS
I'm following [Handmade Penguin](http://davidgow.net/handmadepenguin) by [David Gow](http://davidgow.net/)
because I use OSX.

#Â Not a Game Developer

I'm not a Game Developer, I which I was but I guess I didn't put much effort searching for places to learn how to do so.
So this is my oportunity to try it out, and that's what this repo is about: learn, sweat and swears and mostly fun!

Thanks for passing by
David Silva
